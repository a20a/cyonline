Here I will list what the issues I faced during the turorial and how I was able to resolve them

In Part 2: Cypress E2E Web Automation | How To Write & Run Tests in Cypress
  I faced no issues followinf the tutorial, however, while I tried to push the local changes to the remote repo "cyonline" there were some errors because I did not initialize the remote repo locally and did not add the changes by "git add ." before trying to commit.
